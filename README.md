The Emami Robotics Alliance (ERA) is a student-led, intercollegiate robotics network
designed to connect engineering and robotics clubs across institutions into a shared
ecosystem for building, competing, and scaling real hardware projects.
ERA addresses a common issue in collegiate robotics: fragmentation. Many clubs have
motivated students, but limited resources, isolated technical knowledge, and no consistent
intercollegiate competition structure. ERA provides shared infrastructure, standardized
competitions, and a cross-campus collaboration network—allowing clubs to achieve
significantly more together than independently.
ERA is execution-focused, hands-on, and built to scale beyond a single campus or
year.
